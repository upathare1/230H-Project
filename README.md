Implementation of CoVaR as described in the Adrian and Brunnermeier (A&B) paper.

CoVaR, or Conditional VaR, is an alternative measure of risk that conditions an institution's loss probability on the health of the entire financial system.

We attempt to replicate and expand the time-frame of the original A&B paper.

See `Code/VaR Construction.ipynb` for details.
